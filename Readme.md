Rule extraction from Decision Tree Regressors
- 
This project is a research on how to extract rules from the existing data. 
The dataset used to train the model and extract rules is [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html). The goal is to extract the rules based on which the taxes are formed.

Rule extraction works as follows:
- Decision Tree Regressor is trained on data provided in data/apartments_sale.csv
- Decision tree is traversed and rules are extracted into data/extracted_rules.json file
- Since some rules are redundant they are simplified by simplify_rules.py script (Eg: greater than 2 and greater than 3 becomes greater than 3). 
- Simplified rules are then refactored - for all the pairs of conditions that exist in more than 5% of generated rules refactoring is performed: 
Each pair becomes a subrule that is then used as a 'variable' in the rules where the pair is found.  


## How to run

`NOTE: Make sure you have python 3.7 installed with all the requirements listed in requirements.txt`
1. Run main.py - trains a model and extracts raw rule json into data/extracted_rules.jsonj
2. Run simplify_rules.py - loads data/extracted_rules.json and eliminates redundant rules. `Eg: greater than 2 and greater than 3 becomes greater than 3` 
3. Run refactor_rules.py - simplifies rules by introducing variable-like clauses
4. Run human_readable_rules.py - extracts human readable rules and writes them to data/human_readable_rules.csv

After rules and subrules are extracted subrules can be renamed by experts in order to better match the domain.
